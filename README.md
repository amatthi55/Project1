## Conclusion

In conclusion, salary broken out by age, race, gender, and industry all saw positive growth over the past years.  For industry, we saw that Computer and Math based jobs saw the greatest growth.  As data becomes more becomes the source of truth in the world programmers with the ability to dive through large datasets are becoming a valuable asset to a company.  

Gender wage gap across all age groups has decreased over the last 15 years. The younger the age group the faster the wage gap shrinks.  The gender gap in median wages for the 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64 year old age groups is very similar.  The gender gap in wages for 25-34 year olds is significantly smaller than other age groups.  In the last five years the gender gap in median wages for those 65 and older has increased significantly.

In each Group of Asian men has the highest weekly earnings from 2002 to 2018 in US, it also has the maximum growth  rate and lowest workers compared to other groups.

During 2010, all races have a lower growth rate , the Asian and Hispanic or Latino  groups even have a negative growth  in US

NBA Average Salaries are obvious an outlier to the rest of the country.  Average pay for “Ballers” is on the rise much like the rest of the industries, but it does show fluctuations.  Once we get to 2002, there were very few Ballers in the sample,as the average life of a player is short.
